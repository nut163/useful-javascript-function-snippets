Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files we are generating are not explicitly mentioned. However, considering the nature of the files, we can infer some potential shared dependencies:

1. **JavaScript Language**: All files are JavaScript files, so they share the JavaScript language syntax and semantics.

2. **Common JavaScript Functions**: There might be common utility functions that are used across multiple files. These could be functions for data manipulation, error handling, etc.

3. **DOM Elements**: The frontend JavaScript files might interact with the same DOM elements. The id names of these elements would be shared dependencies.

4. **Event Names**: The frontend JavaScript files might listen to the same events (like click, submit, etc.). These event names would be shared dependencies.

5. **Express.js**: The backend JavaScript files might use Express.js for handling HTTP requests. The Express.js methods and middleware would be shared dependencies.

6. **Mongoose.js**: The backend JavaScript files might use Mongoose.js for interacting with MongoDB. The Mongoose.js methods and schemas would be shared dependencies.

7. **Error Messages**: Both frontend and backend JavaScript files might use the same error messages for error handling.

8. **Route Names**: The backend JavaScript files might define the same routes for handling HTTP requests. These route names would be shared dependencies.

Please note that without specific code snippets or a more detailed description of the application, it's hard to provide a comprehensive list of shared dependencies.
